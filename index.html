        <h2>Scratch Falling Game</h2>
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326071764">Try it!</a></p>
        <p>This is my custom game I made in Scratch. As you fall avoid the black with the left and right arrow keys, as you progress levels, you will fall faster. The beat drops around level 4 and the vocals come in around level 15. It may be impossible to hear the whole song </p>

        <h2>Congressional App Challenge Drawing App</h2>
        <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=imateo&ProjectName=DrawSumn">TRY IT YOURSELF! PLS!</a></p>
        <p>This is a drawing app that I made for the congressional app challenge. I made it with the intention of teaching young children geometric ideas in a fun a way. The class was assigned to make a drawing app for the Congressional app challenge. The only help I had was that of my partner for the project Jian Herrera. To operate it just click around, I tried to make it similar to drawing apps like MicroSoft Paint. I learned how buttons interact to make things actually work and how they are just a sprite that changes when clicked or when the screen changes. I thought they were more impactful than they are. It was my first time coding something that is supposed to actually function and I had to make it look good so someone would actually want to use it.</p>
